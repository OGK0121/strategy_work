# strategy_work
TLDR: Somewhere to put any research (no matter how basic/rubbish!) into systematic trading strategies.

## Overview
This repository is intended to showcase research and implementation of systematic trading strategies, including (but not limited to) topics such as:
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning for trading
- Feature selection and alpha signals
- Short, medium, and long-term trading strategies
- Backtesting and risk management
- Alternative data integration

Each project follows a structured approach: __data acquisition__ --> __feature engineering__ --> __strategy development__ --> __backtesting__ --> __performance evaluation__
